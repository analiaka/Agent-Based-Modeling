# Agent-Based Model Repository

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the creation of an **Agent-Based Model (ABM)** and documents the step-by-step process leading up to its development. The workflow integrates data preparation, exploratory analyses, dimensionality reduction, and clustering to establish a robust foundation for ABM design. By following the steps outlined in this repository, users can analyze survey data, assess its suitability for modeling, and use the findings to inform and create an ABM tailored to specific research questions or use cases.

## Repository Structure

- **`data/`**: Use your own survey data because datasets required for analyses are not provided.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for each step in the workflow.
- **`scripts/`**: Python scripts for replicating key analyses and generating models.
- **`results/`**: Outputs from PCA, clustering, and ABM simulations.
- **`README.md`**: This documentation file.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Survey Data Analysis
Analyze survey data to extract meaningful insights. This includes:
- Cleaning and preprocessing raw survey data.
- Encoding categorical variables (e.g., transforming Likert scale responses).
- Preparing the data for statistical and machine learning workflows.

**Key Notebook**: `notebooks/01_survey_data_analysis.ipynb`

### 2. Working with Different Data Formats
Handle various data formats (e.g., CSV, Excel, JSON) to ensure compatibility with analytical tools. This step focuses on:
- Data import/export operations.
- Merging and reshaping data to prepare for downstream analyses.

**Key Notebook**: `notebooks/02_data_formats.ipynb`

### 3. Suitability Tests for PCA
Assess the dataset’s suitability for dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) by:
- Conducting **Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO)** and **Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity**.
- Evaluating internal consistency using **Cronbach’s Alpha**.

**Key Notebook**: `notebooks/03_pca_suitability_tests.ipynb`

### 4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Cluster Analysis (CA)
Reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining the most important features by:
- Standardizing numeric data.
- Performing PCA to extract key components.
- Visualizing results using scree plots, cumulative explained variance plots, and biplots.

Group similar observations to uncover patterns in the data, which can inform agent behavior in the ABM. This involves:
- Applying clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means, hierarchical clustering).
- Selecting the optimal number of clusters using elbow plots and silhouette scores.
- Interpreting clusters to define agent types and decision-making frameworks.

**Key Notebook**: `notebooks/05_cluster_analysis.ipynb`

### 5. Creating the Agent-Based Model (ABM)
Develop an ABM based on the insights gained from survey data and clustering. Key steps include:
- Defining agents, their attributes, and behaviors.
- Designing interactions and environmental dynamics.
- Simulating the model and analyzing outputs.

**Key Notebook**: `notebooks/06_agent_based_model.ipynb`
